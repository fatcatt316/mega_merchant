####In which Joe explores the wild world of Elixir n' Phoenix.


##Purpose
To learn me some Elixir n' Phoenix. I'm gonna dedicate the month of October to getting better at Elixir, and to getting a working Elixir app deployed.

I plan on putting at least *2 hours a week* into this.

If you know any Elixir, feel free to leave comments about my rookie mistakes.

Thanks!

## Phoenix Stuff

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).

## Joe Notes

"IEX" = "Interactive Elixir"  

Start console with dependencies:  
`iex -S mix`

Start server with dependencies:  
`iex -S mix phoenix.server`

### Database

Configuration:  
`config/dev.exs`
